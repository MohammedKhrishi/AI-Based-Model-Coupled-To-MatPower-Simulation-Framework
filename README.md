## AI-Based-Model-Coupled-To-MATPOWER-Simulation-Framework

# Integrating AI models with MATPOWER for power system optimization involves a multi-step process that combines machine learning for predictive analytics with power flow simulations. Here's a comprehensive guide to building such a system using synthetic data, inspired by methodologies like those presented in the paper "Optimization of Power System Flexibility Through AI‚ÄêDriven Dynamic Load Management and Renewable Integration" .

 
 # Step-by-Step Workflow

1. Synthetic Data Generation
Load Profiles: Create synthetic load profiles for each bus in the IEEE 14-bus system. These profiles should reflect daily and seasonal variations.

Renewable Generation: Simulate renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind) by generating time-series data that mimic typical generation patterns, incorporating variability and intermittency.

Data Structure: Organize the data into a structured format, such as a CSV file, with timestamps and corresponding load/generation values for each bus.

2. Transformer-Based AI Model Development

Model Selection: Choose a transformer architecture suitable for time-series forecasting. Transformers are effective due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data .

Input Features: Use historical load and generation data as input features. Incorporate additional relevant features if available, such as weather conditions.

Training: Train the model to predict future load and generation values. Use appropriate loss functions (e.g., Mean Squared Error) and validation techniques to ensure accuracy.

3. Integration with MATPOWER
MATPOWER Setup: Ensure MATPOWER is installed and configured in your MATLAB environment.

Data Injection: Use the AI model's forecasts to update the load and generation values in the MATPOWER case files (e.g., case14.m). This involves modifying the bus and gen matrices with the predicted values.

Simulation: Run power flow simulations using MATPOWER's functions (e.g., runpf) to analyze the system's performance under the forecasted conditions.

4. Performance Evaluation
Metrics: Assess system performance using metrics such as total power losses, voltage stability indices (e.g., Fast Voltage Stability Index - FVSI), and renewable energy utilization rates.

Comparative Analysis: Compare the AI-driven approach with traditional forecasting methods (e.g., ARIMA) to evaluate improvements in accuracy and system efficiency.
